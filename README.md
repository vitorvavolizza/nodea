This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, do these steps to install the necessary dependencies and packages:
1. clone repo
2. create a file in the root called .env.local, and in this file add OPENAI_API_KEY="...." with the key with the exact syntax. [We have attached this .env.local file to our canvas submission, so you should be able to get the api key from there]
3. run npm install

Then, run the development server with "npm run dev":

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
